    "Freezing a layer in a neural network model means preventing its weights from being updated during the training process. When you freeze a layer, its weights remain constant and are not adjusted based on the optimization algorithm's updates (e.g., gradient descent) during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Freezing layers is a common technique in transfer learning and fine-tuning scenarios, where you may have a pre-trained model and want to adapt it to a new task or dataset. By freezing certain layers, you preserve the knowledge encoded in those layers while allowing the model to learn new patterns in the unfrozen layers.\n",

    "\n",
    "Transfer Learning: When you have a pre-trained model trained on a large dataset (e.g., ImageNet), you might want to use it as a starting point for a new task. Freezing the early layers, which capture generic features like edges and textures, allows you to retain these learned features while training only the later layers on your specific task and dataset.\n",
    "Preventing Overfitting: Freezing layers can help prevent overfitting, especially when you have a limited amount of training data. By freezing some of the layers and reducing the number of trainable parameters, you can reduce the risk of overfitting to the training data.\n",
    "Computational Efficiency: Training deep neural networks can be computationally expensive, especially if the model has many parameters. Freezing layers reduces the computational cost since the frozen layers don't require gradient computations during training.\n",
    "When freezing layers, it's essential to consider which layers to freeze and which ones to leave trainable. Typically, you freeze the early layers (closer to the input) and leave the later layers (closer to the output) trainable, as the early layers capture more general features that are likely relevant to your task. However, the specific strategy may vary depending on the dataset, model architecture, and task at hand.\n",
